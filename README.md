The term "bola" refers to a traditional missile weapon (typically stones wrapped in leather attached to the ends of a cord) employed by indigenous peoples for hunting and capturing animals in South America.

Folders include the following information:

MD: minimization and equilibration files from initially concentric vesicles under confinement (spheres.gro). Intermediate structures are also provided. Water molecules not included.

Stalk: minimization, equilibration and production parameter files (.mdp) for the stalk formation using Plumed collective variable Î¾f. Initial structures (.gro) for all systems are provided together with example input parameter files to induce the stalk (induce.dat & groups.dat). Water molecules not included.

Full-fusion: final full-fusion structure files (.gro). Outcomes from 10 trajetory replicas. Water molecules not included.
Production parameters are also included.
